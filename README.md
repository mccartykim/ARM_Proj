# ARM_Proj
A final project from Montclair State University's CSIT  230 (computer systems), where I put together a prime sieve and Fibonacci sequence, and walked a partner through writing a temperature conversion program.  This project was done in ARM asm after spending the rest of the class using MIPS asm, and a big part of the project was getting familiar with Keil MDK.  Worse yet, both my partner and me weren't using Windows, so I had to use Wine and he broke down and bought Parallels for his Mac.

I believe the intent of the project was to test if we could take the general concept (assembly language for a RISC-style processor) and use the documents and tools for an unfamiliar but similar architecture.
